 I Combine Google Trends with other Time Series Data(This data between 2011 to 2021). Let's investigate using 🐼 Pandas and Matplotlib in 🐍 Python :
 
 1️⃣How search volume for "Bitcoin" relates to the price of Bitcoin 
 
 2️⃣How search volume for a hot stock like #Telsa relates to that stock's price and 
 
 3️⃣How searches for "Unemployment Benefits" vary with the actual unemployment rate in the United States
